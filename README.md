Project Purpose

This project provides a weather API developed using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.0 technologies. The project facilitates API documentation using OpenAPI documentation and manages data using Spring Data JPA with an H2 in-memory database.

In addition, the project features Spring Cache to cache data , Spring Validation and Custom Anonation to validate incoming requests.

Another feature of the project is rate limiting support, which controls the number and frequency of requests made to the API to prevent spam requests and improve API performance.

Docker and Docker Compose are used to provide fast and easy deployment of the project. Github Actions is used to automatically run tests and create a Docker image for the project.

Finally, Prometheus and Grafana are used to monitor the performance and status of the API. This provides tools to detect real-time system performance and issues.
